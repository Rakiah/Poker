## Synopsis

Source code for the poker game project you can download at Rakiah.com/poker.rar
The server is fully authoritative and hosted on a virtual server that i own, you can connect anytime
and play with someone (two players are required to start the game, and its capped at 9 players)
the server automatically cleanup itself after every game and stay on even if there is numerous
connection/disconnection.

## Why

Always loved poker and i tought i would make one myself to see how i could make it work, one
of the challenge was to make it in multiplayer and cheat proof.
Im pretty happy with the result because even if players are receiving seamless cards,
only the server is aware of everyone card which make it unpossible to cheat that way.
also, i had to make sure that no matter what players do the server should be constantly
running and never having an error that he can't recover from alone.
i still have to test it out but for now it look like its working flawlessly.
